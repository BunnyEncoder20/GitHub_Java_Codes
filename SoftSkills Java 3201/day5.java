/*
 *  Theory :
 * 
 *  a = b + c
 *  a,b,c are oprands
 *  =,+ are operators
 * 
 *  Types of operators :
 *  Arithematic, Logical, Unary, Relational, Bitwise, Special, Assignment
 * 
 *  Arithematic Operators : +,-,/,*,% (*Note / returns Quotiente and % returns Remainder)
 * 
 *  Unary Operators : ++,--,~,!,+,- (+,- reperesents positive and negative value,~)
 *  ++ and -- can be of 2 types, pre and post increamant and decrement
 *  ++a will first go to memory and update it, then print the value
 *  a-- will first print the value and then it will go to the memory to update the value
 *  
 *  Relational, Comparsion Operators 
 *  == used to compare 2 values
 *  >,<,>=,<= you know these
 *  != used to check if not equal
 * 
 *  Logical Operators
 *  && and gate
 *  || or gate
 *  ! not gate
 * 
 *  Assignment Operators 
 *  = assign value of RHS to LHS
 *  a+=b means a = a+b
 *  -= means a = a-b
 *  *= means a = a*b
 *  /= means a = a/b
 * 
 *  Bitwise
 *  & bitwise and
 *  | bitwise or 
 *  >> logical shift right
 *  << logical shift left
 *  ^ bitwise XOR (similar = 0 , disimilar = 1)
 *  ~ 
 *  10 & 20 = (01010) && (10100) = (00000) = 0
 *  10 | 20 = (01010) || (10100) = (11110) = 30
 *  10^20 = (01010) ^ (10100) = (11110) = 30
